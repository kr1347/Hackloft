In the previous sprint, my primary contribution to the team’s progress was researching and selecting a suitable database for our coding problems. Given that our project requires a robust and efficient way to manage and store problem data for a user-driven platform, it was essential to identify a database solution that could handle high volume, ensure data security, and support scalability for future expansion. This task involved comparing various database options, considering both relational and non-relational models, and ultimately recommending one that best fits our project’s needs. This research allowed the team to move forward with a clear foundation for storing and retrieving coding problems.
During the sprint, I faced some challenges in understanding the nuances of each database option, especially with regard to query efficiency and integration with the rest of our platform’s stack. Initially, I struggled with choosing between SQL and NoSQL solutions, as each offers distinct advantages depending on our project’s requirements. To address this, I consulted with team members who had more experience in database architecture and referred to documentation and case studies on similar projects. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into database performance considerations and how to align our selection with project needs.
This sprint taught me a great deal about database management, particularly in evaluating databases based on their performance, scalability, and compatibility with different project needs. I also deepened my understanding of how to integrate databases into larger systems, learning about key considerations like data normalization, indexing, and optimization strategies.
Looking forward, I believe my own work could improve in terms of time management. I initially underestimated the time needed for thorough research, which slightly delayed our progress. In future sprints, I plan to allocate more time to complex research tasks and communicate any expected delays to the team sooner. As for our team’s process, I think establishing a collaborative documentation system would be beneficial, allowing us to share research and findings more effectively across team members. This could streamline future decision-making and help us maintain a centralized knowledge base that supports our development process.
