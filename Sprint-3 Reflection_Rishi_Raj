In the previous sprint, I focused on backend development and ensuring smooth integration with the frontend to build a functional, real-time coding interface for Hackloft. My primary contributions included setting up Judge0 as the backend engine for multi-language code execution and configuring it to handle diverse user inputs. I also integrated this backend with a React-based frontend, leveraging the Monaco Editor to deliver a dynamic and interactive coding experience. Additionally, I established real-time communication using Flask and Socket.IO, which significantly enhanced the responsiveness of the application. These contributions were essential in advancing the project toward its goal of providing a seamless, user-friendly interface for coding.

During the sprint, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving skills. A major roadblock was managing payload formatting and asynchronous responses between the frontend and backend, which required careful debugging to maintain smooth interactions. Another significant challenge arose during dependency upgrades, particularly with recurring ESLint and .eslintcache issues, which disrupted the build process. I addressed these by clearing the cache, adjusting file permissions, and ensuring the dependencies were updated correctly. These obstacles not only delayed progress temporarily but also helped me develop a systematic approach to troubleshooting complex problems.

This sprint provided valuable learning opportunities, particularly in backend-to-frontend communication and API integration. I gained hands-on experience with Flask and Socket.IO for real-time interactions and improved my understanding of state management and callback handling in React through the Monaco Editor integration. Additionally, I honed my debugging skills and gained insights into managing and resolving dependency conflicts. These experiences have expanded my technical skillset and given me greater confidence in tackling similar challenges in the future.

Looking ahead, there are areas where I could improve my workflow and the team’s process. For instance, better code modularization from the start—dividing functionalities into reusable components—would reduce complexity and streamline development. Adding more robust error-handling mechanisms, particularly for user inputs, could improve the overall resilience of the application. Finally, enhancing documentation, including inline comments and architectural overviews, would make the codebase more accessible to current and future contributors. By focusing on these improvements, I aim to deliver a more efficient and user-friendly platform in the next sprint.
