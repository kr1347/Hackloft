As part of this project, I took on the responsibility of developing key aspects of the backend, focusing on routes, middleware, and utility functions. My work was aimed at ensuring the application was both functional and secure, providing a solid foundation for the overall system. One of my primary tasks was managing the ⁠ authMiddleware.js ⁠ file. This middleware is crucial because it acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring only authenticated users have access to specific routes and functionalities. By implementing robust authentication checks, I helped protect sensitive data and functionality, such as user dashboards and problem submissions, from unauthorized access.

In the ⁠ routes ⁠ folder, I worked on several critical files, each serving a unique purpose in the application. For example, the ⁠ auth.js ⁠ file handled user authentication processes, including login and signup, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for users. The ⁠ challenge.js ⁠ and ⁠ problemRoutes.js ⁠ files were designed to handle challenges and problems, enabling users to retrieve, submit, and interact with coding problems. Similarly, the ⁠ execute.js ⁠ file was focused on setting up an endpoint for executing user-submitted code, allowing the application to provide real-time feedback on solutions. The ⁠ protected.js ⁠ and ⁠ solutions.js ⁠ files ensured secure access to user-specific data and managed the storage and retrieval of problem solutions.

In addition to the routes, I also worked on utility functions located in the ⁠ utils ⁠ folder. One of the most critical utility files I developed was ⁠ executeCode.js ⁠, which is responsible for running user-submitted code securely and efficiently. This involved ensuring that code execution was sandboxed and that resource constraints were properly handled to prevent abuse or crashes. Another significant file, ⁠ sendOtp.js ⁠, implemented the functionality for sending one-time passwords (OTPs). This was a vital feature for enhancing user security during actions like account recovery or two-factor authentication.

Lastly, I managed the ⁠ server.js ⁠ file, which serves as the backbone of the backend. This file was essential for configuring the server and ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. I focused on structuring the server to handle requests efficiently, incorporating middleware for logging, parsing, and error handling.

Overall, my work in routes, middleware, and utilities contributed to creating a backend that was secure, functional, and scalable, providing the necessary support for a seamless user experience.
