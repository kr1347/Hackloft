During this sprint, I focused on the problem-solving and compiler-related components of our application, managing both compiler.html and problems.html as well as the corresponding JavaScript files: compiler.js, problemData.js, problems.js, and user.js. My contributions were critical in developing key features of the platform. Specifically, I built a fully functional code editor in compiler.js, complete with syntax highlighting and live error feedback, providing users with an intuitive and efficient environment for solving coding problems. In problems.js, I implemented logic to dynamically fetch, display, and update problems based on user progress, creating an engaging and interactive user experience. Additionally, I enhanced user.js to manage user authentication, track progress, and seamlessly integrate with the platformâ€™s backend, ensuring accurate data handling and improved user functionality.

Despite the progress, the sprint was not without its challenges. One significant hurdle was optimizing the compiler to handle multiple programming languages efficiently. This required extensive debugging and refining of the code to minimize latency while maintaining functionality. Another challenge arose with managing asynchronous operations in problems.js when fetching and updating problem data. Initially, this caused delays and inconsistencies in the user interface. However, I resolved these issues by applying best practices in JavaScript, including Promises and async/await, which greatly improved the reliability and responsiveness of the application.

This sprint was a valuable learning experience. I gained a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming and how to design and implement interactive front-end components that integrate seamlessly with backend systems. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills by tackling the complex task of creating a multi-language compiler and ensuring its performance met user expectations.

Looking back, one area that could be improved is team communication and task delegation. At times, unclear boundaries led to overlapping efforts and redundant work. Implementing a more structured workflow and clearly defining individual responsibilities would have reduced inefficiencies and allowed us to progress even further. Overall, this sprint was productive and enriching, as it allowed me to contribute significantly to the project while developing new technical and collaborative skills.
