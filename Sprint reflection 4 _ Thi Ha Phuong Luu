During this project, I was responsible for managing the core user experience related to challenges, dashboards, and leaderboards. I successfully developed and structured three HTML files: dashboard.html, challenges.html, and leader.html. These pages were designed to provide a user-friendly interface, allowing seamless navigation between sections, challenge submissions, and leaderboard tracking. Additionally, I implemented the corresponding JavaScript files—dashboard.js, challenge.js, and leaderboard.js—to handle user interactions, dynamic updates, and real-time functionality across these areas. This resulted in a cohesive and interactive user experience that kept users engaged.

One of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring smooth interaction between the front-end and back-end, particularly with real-time updates for challenge submissions and leaderboard rankings. Coordinating the asynchronous operations in JavaScript, such as handling form submissions, fetching data, and updating the interface dynamically, was a learning curve. Ensuring these updates happened without affecting the overall performance or user experience required debugging and optimizing my code.

Throughout this process, I learned a great deal about front-end design principles, JavaScript event handling, and the complexities of real-time updates in web applications. I gained valuable experience in writing clean, efficient code that connects the front-end with back-end functionality, and I also improved my ability to troubleshoot and resolve technical issues.

One area that could have been improved was the initial planning and structuring of the HTML layouts. If I had spent more time wireframing and testing different designs before implementing them, I could have reduced some of the later adjustments that were needed to improve usability. Additionally, more collaboration with the back-end team from the outset would have made the integration process smoother, reducing time spent debugging connectivity issues between the client-side and server-side code.
