In this sprint, I built upon the foundation established in the previous phase and focused on extending Hackloft’s capabilities while enhancing user experience. My primary contributions included expanding the backend API integration to support multi-language code execution, enabling users to compile and execute Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript in real time. I also worked on improving the communication pipeline between the frontend and backend, ensuring that results were displayed quickly and accurately. Additionally, I contributed to enhancing the customization features of the code editor, such as retaining user settings through local storage, which provided a more personalized and accessible interface.
One major challenge I encountered was optimizing the performance of the platform when executing complex or large code snippets. The communication lag between the backend and frontend occasionally disrupted the real-time experience for users. To address this, I focused on streamlining the data flow by refining payload structures and minimizing redundant API calls. Another challenge was ensuring cross-browser compatibility for the new features, particularly the editor’s customization options. I resolved this by conducting extensive browser testing and making targeted CSS adjustments to maintain consistency across platforms.
Looking ahead, I plan to focus on enhancing the visual design of the platform to make it more engaging and modern. Additionally, implementing a competitive point system for users to track their progress and compete with friends will be a priority. Finally, I aim to introduce modularization into the codebase to improve scalability and maintainability, ensuring that the platform remains efficient and adaptable as new features are added. These goals will help us refine the platform further and deliver an even better user experience in the next sprint.
